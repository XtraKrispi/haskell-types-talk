<h1>The Type System</h1>
<h2>Parameterized Types</h2>

<p>Haskell has support for types parameterized on one or more other types</p>
<p>
  <pre>
    <code class="haskell">
      data Maybe a = Nothing
                   | Just a
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>This means that <code>Maybe</code> is parameterized on any type <code>a</code>, so <code>Maybe</code> acts as a 
  container of sorts to a type <code>a</code>
  </p>
  <p>Notice the <code>a</code> in the <code>Just</code> branch of the type
  </p>
  <p>
    These are all valid:
    <pre>
      <code class="haskell">
        x = Just 5 -- Maybe Int
        y = Just True -- Maybe Bool
        z = Just "Hello" -- Maybe String

        foo :: Maybe a -> String
        bar :: Maybe Int -> Int
      </code>
    </pre>
  </p>
