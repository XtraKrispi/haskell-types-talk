<h1>The Type System</h1>
<h2>Parameterized Types (Part 2)</h2>

<p>Parameterized types can have multiple types</p>
<pre>
  <code class="haskell">
    data Either a b = Left  a
                    | Right b
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  This means that <code>Either</code> is parameterized on two types, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>,
  which don't have to be the same type (hence the different letters).  
</p>
<p>
  The actual letters or words used to denote the type
  don't matter, as long as they are lowercase.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> Types <strong>MUST</strong> start with a capital, and generic types, functions and values 
  must start with a lowercase letter.
</p>
