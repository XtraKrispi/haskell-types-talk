<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>Functions are defined with the following syntax:</p>
<pre class="language-haskell">
  <code class="language-haskell">
    add :: Int -> Int -> Int
    add a b = a + b
   
    myMap :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
    myMap fn [] = []
    myMap fn (x : xs) = fn x : myMap fn xs
  </code>
</pre>
<p>Notice that functions can be passed as arguments as well</p>
<p>This is also perfectly valid:</p>
<pre class="language-haskell">
  <code class="language-haskell">
    add a b = a + b

    myMap fn [] = []
    myMap fn (x:xs) = fn x : myMap fn xs
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  Haskell has a very strong <em>type inference</em> engine that can figure out your 
  types the vast majority of the time.
